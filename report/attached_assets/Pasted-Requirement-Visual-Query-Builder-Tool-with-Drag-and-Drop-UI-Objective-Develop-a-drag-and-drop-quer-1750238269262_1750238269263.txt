Requirement: Visual Query Builder Tool with Drag-and-Drop UI
Objective:
Develop a drag-and-drop query builder UI tool that enables non-technical users (without SQL knowledge) to visually construct complex SQL queries and generate tabular reports from them.

Technology Stack:
Frontend:

ReactJS for building the interactive UI.

Drag-and-Drop Libraries (e.g., react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd) for visual query construction.

REST API integration to communicate with the backend.

UI libraries (e.g., Material UI or Ant Design) for consistent styling and UX.

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests and business logic.

PostgreSQL as the primary relational database.

SQL generation logic to convert UI inputs into executable PostgreSQL queries.

Core Functionality:
Visual Drag-and-Drop Interface:

Users build SQL queries through a graphical interface using drag-and-drop components.

Manual SQL writing is not required.

Query Construction Flow:

Step 1: Table Selection

User selects one or more tables from the database schema.

Step 2: Column Population

Based on the selected tables, related columns are dynamically populated for user selection.

Step 3: Query Building

Users define filters, conditions, joins, functions, and other operations using drag-and-drop controls.

Supported Features:

Subqueries:

Ability to insert subqueries within filters, conditions, or selected fields.

Subqueries are also built using the same visual interface.

SQL Keywords:

Support for DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.

SQL Functions:

Include DATE_TRUNC, aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG), and others.

Aliases and Descriptions:

Users can define alias names for selected columns.

Optional descriptions for documentation or understanding column purpose.

Editing and Flexibility:

All query components (tables, conditions, functions, etc.) should be modifiable.

Allow in-place editing of subqueries and operations.

Final Output:

Generated query is executed on the backend via PostgreSQL.

The resulting data is rendered in a table format on the frontend.

Optionally, allow users to download or export the report (CSV, Excel, etc.).

User Profile:
Non-SQL users familiar with the database structure (tables and columns).

They will rely on UI-driven interactions instead of writing SQL.

Technical Considerations:
Secure and optimize REST API communication between frontend and backend.

Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.

Use SQL generation libraries or custom logic on the backend to translate UI actions into valid PostgreSQL queries.

Support query performance monitoring and error reporting in case of invalid configurations.
